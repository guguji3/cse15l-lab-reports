**3. Trying Some Commands**
-
* Try running the commands `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `cp` on your computer
* I ran the `ls -lat` command in my terminal
* The `ls -lat` command lists the files and directories in the current working directory, sorted by modification time (newest first), and showing hidden files.
